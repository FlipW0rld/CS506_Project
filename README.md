## Introduction
Public transportation is a vital aspect of urban life, providing a reliable and cost-effective means of mobility for residents and students alike. Among the many bus routes in Boston, Route 57 serves as a key transit option for Boston University students, connecting them to various stops across the city. However, the uncertainty of bus arrival times, influenced by factors such as weather conditions, traffic, and passenger load, often creates inconvenience for passengers.

This project seeks to address this issue by developing a predictive model for the arrival times of Route 57 buses at designated stations. By leveraging real-world data, including weather conditions, weekday patterns, and bus schedules, we aim to enhance the commuting experience for Boston University students. The insights from this project can potentially contribute to more efficient route planning and better time management for daily commuters.

## Project Overview

The Boston 57 bus passes through multiple stops at Boston University and serves as o
ne of the transportation options for Boston University students. This project aims to predict the arrival time of bus route 57 at designated stations based on factors such as weather conditions, weekday patterns, and passenger numbers.

## Methodology (方法)

### Data Decirption and Collection:

Data was collected from October 7th to November 31st. The collected data includes:

- Date
- Weekday
- Bus arrival time
- Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy)
  - Temperature at 2 meters
  - sensible temperature
  - Precipitation
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Cloud cover

Team members took turns recording bus arrival times either through on-site observation or using bus query applications such as Google Maps and MBTA Website.
